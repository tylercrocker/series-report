# SeriesReport

Personal application for tracking series information for books.

Uses several data sources including ISBNdb.com (via API), OpenLibrary.org (via monthly imports), and allows for personal Goodreads imports.

Handles a fair amount of data cleanup and standardization from its sources in addition to series title parsing heuristics.

MASSIVE work in progress.
